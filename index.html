<h2> Personal Information</h2>

<p> Can Gio is my hometown which is an outskirts of Ho Chi Minh city which is a biosphere reserve listed by UNESCO. Because of the poor transportation system especially waiting for the ferry, it takes me longer than others to go to school or downtown. However, it is not a very well-known tourist destination for international visitors but it appeals to huge citizens who live in HCMC for relaxing because of the great environment and delicious food. Besides, I used to immerse myself in video games a lot and my health became worse when I was in high school but I have changed it due to exercising with my friends. My body transferred gradually and my health markedly improved. Because of that reason, I am not interested in games anymore and instead of playing games, I usually do some exercise such as running, going to the gym and I just consider games as an entertainment thing which makes me relax after a busy day.

<h2> Interest in IT</h2>
<p>

IT is a highly developed industry currently and everything in our daily lives is related to it which can help us improve our lives. IT also has a diverse field that depends on people’s characteristics and interests to choose the suitable one and I honestly think that I haven’t entirely found a field that I want to immerse myself in. However, computers, websites, and security are some of the fields that I might feel interested in. Since I was a kid, my parents owned a small computer gaming store that was not as popular as nowadays but it attracted lots of people at that time because of the development of technology increases and led me to access some basics of the technology and computers. Gradually, I learned a lot about computers from helping my parents manage the store and when I saw my dad work together with the IT guys to fix computer problems such as reassembling the computer and doing some stuff about the software, I was instantly inspired at that time.
<h3> Reason to choose RMIT University</h3>
<p> RMIT is an international university which is considered one of the best universities in Vietnam. Firstly,  I chose RMIT for studying because the curriculum’s RMIT is entirely in English which is the most popular language currently and English is an essential language with the young generation to have a good job. Secondly,  because of studying in the international environment, not only learning English skills but also acquiring a lot of soft, technical skills and experience which can help us gain more opportunities to approach with the international companies.
<h3> What expect to learn </h3>
<p> Before studying IT at RMIT University, I just had a little understanding of IT from some of the lessons from high school which was some basic skills and introduction without any specific knowledge in any aspect. Therefore, I literally expect to learn as much as possible to improve my skills and get more foundation knowledge in the IT industry. Moreover, I hope that I could find a suitable field which I am very interested in and immerse myself in which does not make me regret  because of choosing the wrong way after graduating.

    <h3> Job Appealing</h3>
<p>This is absolutely not a great job in the IT industry but this position attracted me instantly after I read through the job information. The most important thing that makes me appeal with this position is that technical sales is one of the potential jobs currently in this industry which could move the ladder rapidly depending on your interests and opportunities. Besides, I’m not very interested in sitting and working in front of the computer all the time and prefer to travel around so choosing this position is a great idea. Moreover, Netnam Corporation is a pioneer in providing Internet services in Vietnam for more than 25 years in this industry and a lot of different awards or bonuses which make this position more attractive for me.
    <h3> Required skills, experiences, qualifications: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Ability to present information fluently in English and Vietnamese and can handle some unexpected situations.
<li>Have knowledge of  LAN, WIFI, Server system, database.
<li>At least 1 years experience in working at a system, networking or related subjects...
<li>Experiences with CCNA, CCNP, MCSA, MCSE, VCP …
<li>Having a desire for progress and adapting quickly in the pressure environment.
    </ul>
</li>

    <h3> Current skills, experiences, qualifications: </h3>
<ul>
<p> I don’t have any much skills, experience or qualifications about the IT industry because I'm just a newbie who has a little interest in technology with some of the basic skills and knowledge which I have learned in high school. However, I have a few experiences about hardware like computers stuff and selling IT products especially smartphones and some stuff related to it from my parents business. I have supported them selling and trading products with the customers so my communication skills are not too bad.
</ul>
<h3> Plan to improve: </h3>
<ul>
<p>Although my communication skills are acceptable, I need to develop my English skills which are really important for this job. Besides, I have to focus more in class and absorb all of the skills from the course of IT to get as much knowledge as possible. Moreover, I will gain my experience by engaging in some of the internship programmes while studying at school and contact more people to improve my communication skills as well as learn more about technical and scientific products.

<h2> Project Idea</h2>
<h3> Overview: </h3>

<ul>
<p>My project idea is to create a Travel-planning app that will arrange and create an ultimate trip without using many apps at the same time depending on the user’s personality and characteristics. The users only need to fill all the information requested and  The Travel-planning app will find and show a lot of different packages which contain all of the information and activities which the travelers can just follow it as an online tour guide for users to choose.
</p>
</ul>
<h3> Motivation: </h3>
<ul>
<p>There are a lot of different travel apps which occurred and were more popular in recent years but these other apps still miss some point or just focus on only 1 aspect such as accommodations, food and travelers have to use many different apps or rely on other services to have a nice vacation. However, this project appears to be able to solve the problem which helps people vacation better with a nice deal and reduce many unrelated costs as well as create more inspiration for others to travel to many different places, thereby developing the country's tourism industry.
</p>
</ul>

<h3> Description: </h3>
<ul>
<p>Currently, traveling has not only become a hobby but also turned into a lifestyle for many people around the world. There are more and more jobs that tend to rely on traveling to be able to develop better such as Travel Bloggers, Youtuber, going abroad, people on vacations, those who travel for business or get experiences, knowledge. Therefore, the Travel-planning apps were created to improve the quality of people’s vacation, trip and make us easier to adapt in a strange place just using a smartphone which always stays with us wherever we go as our second self. People nowadays usually use smartphones to search information, book and buy everything online and it will be the same while traveling so the Travel-planning app is going to be the great app for people instead of spending a long time to organize or using lots of different kinds of apps to plan your trip.
<p>    There is just a little requirement for users to run the app. Firstly, the users should be able to fill out some of the information required, it is not going to be too private information but it's just a few things which relate to the trip which you are going to enjoy. For example, your budget, hobbies, favorite scenery, activities to do or some specifics which attract to do during the vacation … and everyone will have different results depending on their differences about personalities and hobbies. Secondly, From that kind of information, the app will figure out and show the list of packages of different locations which contain all of the necessary information for users and it is not only just about some of the simple things such as some good hotels, delicious restaurant, activities to do … but also contain the specific and details information like how’s the weather of that day, the service of the hotel, restaurant with customers rating, a good time to go out, to eat, to do these kinds of activities which has been launched before but it will cost a little money for that. When people can definitely choose the location which they want to travel, in every package of each place, there are a lot of different options for users to choose or compare each other and find the most suitable option for themself. However, it is not obligatory to follow exactly the structure of the app, it is easy to change it personally and if users who want to explore independently by themself and do not want a trip which is really serious and depend on others, they could just get some suggestion from our people who have experience about that place or follow some of the tips on the app for their trips. Finally, there are a lot of people from our companies who will be available 24/7 to help, guide, and solve the users problems.
</p>
</ul>

<h3> Tools and technologies: </h3>
<ul>
<p>Creating a travel app might be a challenge in any aspect. It requires a lot of different tools, technologies and other skills to make it successful. There are 3 core ways to build a mobile application : from scratch, app-building platforms and outsources. Building a mobile app from scratch directly requires high skills and takes a long time to do so people currently tend to use app-building platforms or outsources such as Ibuildapp, Appy Pie… which are easier to build and save more time but it will take cost. Besides, UI design tools such as Adobe XD, Sketch, InVision are necessary to design your app to become more attractive and use social media platforms like Facebook, Youtube, Instagram to connect and expand your app with users.
</p>
</ul>

    <h3> Skill Required: </h3>
<ul>
<p> It is impossible to create a mobile application independently, you need to have a team who is good at programming, design, and marketing skills and have great cooperation which are the key leads to your app success. Although there are a lot of app-building platforms currently to help create a mobile app easily, you need to have a high programming, well-intentioned and leadership skills to deal with the problem and develop the app to make it more professional, well-optimized. Besides, you should have good understanding skills because it is not the same as other apps, you have to find out the user's physiology to make your app more attractive.</ul>
</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<h3> Outcome: </h3>
<ul>
<p> If a Travel-planning app is successful, it is a huge advantage for users not only fulfilling their passion, but also creating more opportunities, jobs, and motivation for others to feel excited about traveling. It also helps to reduce time and money when people prepare for a trip. Besides, one of the most benefit of this app is that it will boost the country's tourism industry to grow rapidly. However, this is an extremely sophisticated app to build, maintain and generate it effectively. Moreover, the more developed and perfect a travel app is, the more effect on the citizens who earn money from selling stuff or service to travellers because people will rely on the apps and become lazier to explore new things.
